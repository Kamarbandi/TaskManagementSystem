# Task Management System

## Overview
This is a simple **Task Management System** built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The application allows users to create, view, and delete tasks. It also includes basic input validation and error handling.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks by specifying a title.
- **View Tasks**: Fetch and display a list of all existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by ID.
- **Validation**: Ensures that tasks have a valid, non-empty title before they can be created.
